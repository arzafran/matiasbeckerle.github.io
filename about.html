<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>My name is Matias and I'm a computer programmer, software engineer or whatever you want to call me. Someday I hope to make a really good video game.</p>
<p>I know some stuff but there are more things I have to learn. In the meantime I would write here but I can't promise you that's a good thing.</p>

<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Yes, I know. My english skills sucks, I'm from Argentina. For that reason I want to ask you to notify me when you read something misspelled or wrong in anyway. Please create a <a href="https://github.com/matiasbeckerle/matiasbeckerle.github.io/pulls">pull request</a> and I will take a look as soon as possible.</p>
