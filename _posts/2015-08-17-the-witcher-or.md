...one of the best games that I've ever played. For so long I have been far away from video games that now I'm kind of disappointed with myself. That's why I'm playing a game from 2007. What an amazing game. I wanted to say thanks to [everyone involved in the development](http://en.cdprojektred.com/). Thanks for letting us put on the skin of *Geralt of Rivia*. Thanks to my *bearded* friend for recommending the game.
