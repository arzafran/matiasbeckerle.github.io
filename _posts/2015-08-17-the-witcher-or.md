<p>...one of the best games that I've ever played. For so long I have been far away from video games that now I'm kind of disappointed with myself. That's why I'm playing a game from 2007. What an amazing game. I wanted to say thanks to <a href="http://en.cdprojektred.com">everyone involved in the development</a>. Thanks for letting us put on the skin of <strong>Geralt of Rivia</strong>. Thanks to my <strong>bearded</strong> friend for recommending the game.</p>
