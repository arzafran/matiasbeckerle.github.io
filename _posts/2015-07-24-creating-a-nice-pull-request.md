title: Creating a nice pull request

Working in a team requires more than development skills. You need to push yourself harder and try to imagine what your fellow needs. On a team there are pull requests. Here is the GitHub's definition:

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

Seems easy, right? Well... that is not true for all teams. Sometimes I see pull requests without information.

## Asking a review

To create a good pull request I will give you some useful advices (in my opinion):

- A short title with a meaningful overview of what are you trying to introduce in the codebase. This title could also contains a code for reference.
- Descriptions are awesome. With a description you could explain a little more your changes, give a substantiation for a specific solution, advice or warning about something. Provide context, your mate possibly doesn't know anything about your tasks. Remember: your teammates are busy too, the more information you give, the less time you consume of them.
- Mention the reviewers. Don't be anxious: pull requests are *async*. They will take a look only when found some time to do it.
- Answer in the pull request, always. If you talk by private messages another fellow will not know about that talk. A response is useful for everyone. Also serves as a registry.
- Don't take a correction or suggestion as an offence. I believe every developer in the world want to work in a wonderful codebase. Corrections and suggestions are to keep or improve that.

## Making a review

- Be polite, always.
- Sometimes a quick example in pseudo code could be more valuable than a thousand words.
- Ask for more information if you can't understand the whole meaning of a change.
- We know bad code happens but wait: there is awesome code too. Give your fellow a congratulation when achieves something valuable or that deserves a recognition. A proper emoticon could help too.

## Conclusion

A code review is useful for anyone. Yes, tech leads can't know everything. Pull requests and code reviews serves *to everyone* for different reasons:
	
- You can let everyone know about your changes.
- You can learn from others.
- Others can learn from you.
- The codebase grows solid and better.

Finally remember that you are the owner of the code introduced by a pull request. When sometimes goes wrong, you are responsible.

Some time ago I read [a really good post of Mark Seemann](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/). I strongly recommend you to read it because he mention important things to take care on creating a pull request.
