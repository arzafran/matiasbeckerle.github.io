title: Creating a nice pull request
tags : [development, tips]
---

<p>Working in a team requires more than development skills. You need to push yourself harder and try to imagine what your fellow needs. On a team there are pull requests. Here is the GitHub's definition:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems easy, right? Well... that is not true for all teams. Sometimes I see pull requests without information.</p>
<h3>Asking a review</h3>
<p>To create a good pull request I will give you some useful advices (in my opinion):
<ul>
  <li>A short title with a meaningful overview of what are you trying to introduce in the codebase. This title could also contains a code for reference.</li>
  <li>Descriptions are awesome. With a description you could explain a little more your changes, give a substantiation for a specific solution, advice or warning about something. Provide context, your mate possibly doesn't know anything about your tasks. Remember: your teammates are busy too, the more information you give, the less time you consume of them.</li>
  <li>Mention the reviewers. Don't be anxious: pull requests are <em>async</em>. They will take a look only when found some time to do it.</li>
  <li>Answer in the pull request, always. If you talk by private messages another fellow will not know about that talk. A response is useful for everyone. Also serves as a registry.</li>
  <li>Don't take a correction or suggestion as an offence. I believe every developer in the world want to work in a wonderful codebase. Corrections and suggestions are to keep or improve that.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making a review</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Be polite, always.</li>
  <li>Sometimes a quick example in pseudo code could be more valuable than a thousand words.</li>
  <li>Ask for more information if you can't understand the whole meaning of a change.</li>
  <li>We know bad code happens but wait: there is awesome code too. Give your fellow a congratulation when achieves something valuable or that deserves a recognition. A proper emoticon could help too.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A code review is useful for anyone. Yes, tech leads can't know everything. Pull requests and code reviews serves <em>to everyone</em> for different reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can let everyone know about your changes.</li>
  <li>You can learn from others.</li>
  <li>Others can learn from you.</li>
  <li>The codebase grows solid and better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally remember that you are the owner of the code introduced by a pull request. When sometimes goes wrong, you are responsible.</p>

<p>Some time ago I read <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/">a really good post of Mark Seemann</a>. I strongly recommend you to read it because he mention important things to take care on creating a pull request.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong> to Andr√©s for all his wisdom.</p>
