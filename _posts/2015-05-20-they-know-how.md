There is a reason for categorizing some game companies like *Blizzard*, *id Software* and *Valve* of being the best. They know how to make things right and epic. They even doesn't have release dates for their games. A game is **"done when it's done"**.

This week *Diablo 3* has its *third* birthday and if you are playing these days you will find some strange stuff, like cows. *Lot of cows*.

At the beginning there was a lot of expectations and rumors about if we could ever see again the cow level. Even when you had to wait to load a campaign... a subliminal message mentioning the cow level appeared.

But in this week we have our lovely cows in this game too. Blizzard delighted us with [an excelent demostration](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/19083832/debunking-the-cowspiracy-5-14-2015) of being awesome.

Finally the time has come. Enjoy. Thanks *gstn* to let me know about this. Thanks Blizzard too, just for being awesome.
