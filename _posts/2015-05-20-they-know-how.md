<p>There is a reason for categorizing some game companies like <em>Blizzard</em>, <em>id Software</em> and <em>Valve</em> of being the best. They know how to make things right and epic. They even doesn't have release dates for their games. A game is <strong>"done when it's done"</strong>.</p>

<p>This week <em>Diablo 3</em> has its <em>third</em> birthday and if you are playing these days you will find some strange stuff, like cows. <em>Lot of cows</em>.</p>

<p>At the beginning there was a lot of expectations and rumors about if we could ever see again the cow level. Even when you had to wait to load a campaign... a subliminal message mentioning the cow level appeared.</p>
<p>But in this week we have our lovely cows in this game too. Blizzard delighted us with <a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/19083832/debunking-the-cowspiracy-5-14-2015">an excelent demostration</a> of being awesome.</p>

<p>Finally the time has come. Enjoy. Thanks <em>gstn</em> to let me know about this. Thanks Blizzard too, just for being awesome.</p>
