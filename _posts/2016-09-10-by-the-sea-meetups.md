<p>Last couple of months I have been inspired by several people which I had the pleasure to know. It wasn't really obvious until a normal day I figured it out: sharing.</p>
<p>Some folks were involved in a new project they started with the purpose of sharing knowledge, using the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/by-the-Sea-mdp/">meetup</a> format which they called <a href="https://bytheseamdp.github.io/">by the Sea</a> because we are living in a city near to the coast.</p>
<p>At some point they offered me to expose any topic I want so we can all discuss and learn from each other. Why not? I decided to give some advice about <a href="https://slides.com/matiasbeckerle/the-things-no-one-told-me-before-the-first-day">the things no one told me before the first day at work</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed it, you can watch it here on <a href="https://youtu.be/jSOOA34tm7w">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>So the whole point is to share. Wherever you are, even if it seems insignificant. Don't be afraid, someone could learn from that. You learned from someone. I learned from someone. There is someone out there who might learn from you.</p>
