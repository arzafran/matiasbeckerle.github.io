<p>I was at the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org">GGJ</a> early this year when we decided to take a break and eat burguers and drink some beers. Seeing it now in retrospective I could say that the whole event was a very rich experience but that particular night was the best.</p>
<p>We talked about games and that is so great. We share our experiences, anecdotes and we laugh besides each team could achieve the GGJ objective or not. That night the responsibilities didn't matter to us.</p>
<p>I started talking with an unknown colleague about old times: <em>graphic adventures</em>. One of them was <strong>The Legend of Kyrandia</strong>, a game that I've played a little bit when I was a child. I was filled with nostalgia. So I took a chance and I bought it on a <a href="http://www.gog.com">GOG</a> sale with discount. Book one, two and three. Awesome.</p>

<p>Thinking that those old graphics are beautiful means that I am crazy or something? I don't know. But they are, 23 years later. Everything in that game feels really good. Even the voices because if I'm not mistaken was one of the first video games adding that kind of feature.</p>

<p>I want to thank anyone that makes possible this:</p>

  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios">Westwood Studios</a> to achieve such a great video game in 1992.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.gog.com">GOG</a> for fighting against time in order to keep alive those marvels.</li>
  <li>Passionate unknown strangers.</li>
