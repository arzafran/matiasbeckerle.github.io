You may be guessing that I'm re-watching too many episodes from *The X Files*. That's correct but I'm not going to talk about the series. Today is about something that I learned several years ago and still happens to me.

Last week was a mind exhaustive one. I couldn't put any time in my current personal project. Yesterday was Saturday so I decided to spend some time coding on it. It was really great because in 3 or 4 hours I have achieved a good progress and *a funny bug* too:

![One does not simply "shake it off" the camera](/public/img/the-solution-is-out-there/shake-it-off-bug.gif)

> One does not simply "shake it off" the camera. That one was fixed already, don't worry.

Today I spent some time developing too but without any achievement. It was hard to recognize but I spent similar amount of time just to achieve not even a single commit. When the problem was taking too much I chose to abandon for some time. The problem won the battle but not the war. **The idea was to take some air, relax and come back when my mind is clear.**

Luckily 10 minutes after leaving the PC and while taking a shower the solution came to my mind. **I was seeing the problem from the wrong angle.** Simple as that. If you are struggling with something maybe is time to take a break and come back after. I've found that viewing the problem with a clean mind helps to find solutions. I'm not the only one saying it: several people from different communities says the same thing.

Some things requires time. It's pretty similar to an architect: building the foundations for a house requires a natural time for the materials to settle. That's why I do not support working extra/exhaustive amount of time. In the short time everyone loses, not only you for pushing yourself harder and harder. **While crunching you are contributing to build an unmaintainable and unusable software thing.** At the end everyone asks: *why?* Inside and outside the team people blame other people. Why don't you look at yourself and think for a while? Please have the courage. You will find the answer.
