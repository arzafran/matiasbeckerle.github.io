title: The solution is out there

<p>You may be guessing that I'm re-watching too many episodes from <strong>The X Files</strong>. That's correct but I'm not going to talk about the series. Today is about something that I learned several years ago and still happens to me.</p>
<p>Last week was a mind exhaustive one. I couldn't put any time in my current personal project. Yesterday was Saturday so I decided to spend some time coding on it. It was really great because in 3 or 4 hours I have achieved a good progress and <strong>a funny bug</strong> too:</p>

  <p>One does not simply "shake it off" the camera. That one was fixed already, don't worry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today I spent some time developing too but without any achievement. It was hard to recognize but I spent similar amount of time just to achieve not even a single commit. When the problem was taking too much I chose to abandon for some time. The problem won the battle but not the war. <strong>The idea was to take some air, relax and come back when my mind is clear.</strong></p>
<p>Luckily 10 minutes after leaving the PC and while taking a shower the solution came to my mind. <strong>I was seeing the problem from the wrong angle.</strong> Simple as that. If you are struggling with something maybe is time to take a break and come back after. I've found that viewing the problem with a clean mind helps to find solutions. I'm not the only one saying it: several people from different communities says the same thing.</p>
<p>Some things requires time. It's pretty similar to an architect: building the foundations for a house requires a natural time for the materials to settle. That's why I do not support working extra/exhaustive amount of time. In the short time everyone loses, not only you for pushing yourself harder and harder. <strong>While crunching you are contributing to build an unmaintainable and unusable software thing.</strong> At the end everyone asks: <em>why?</em> Inside and outside the team people blame other people. Why don't you look at yourself and think for a while? Please have the courage. You will find the answer.</p>
