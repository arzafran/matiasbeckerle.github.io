Hello there!

My name is Matias and I'm a developer. Someday I hope to make a really good video game.

I know some stuff but there are more things I have to learn. In the meantime I would write here but I can't be sure that's a good thing.

## Language

Yes, I know. My english skills sucks. I'm from Argentina and I couldn't improve enough. For that reason I want to ask you to notify me when you see something wrong. Please create a [pull request](https://github.com/matiasbeckerle/matiasbeckerle.github.io/pulls) and I will take a look as soon as possible.
